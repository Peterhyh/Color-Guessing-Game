# Color-Guessing-Game

A color guessing game I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# What I Learned With This Project:
```
• Understanding how to structure HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript together.
• CSS was used for almost all the styling. (Best practice is to use CSS only for styling)
• JavaScript brings the webpage to life by making it interactive.
• Created a working button.
• Using the combination of Math.floor() and Math.random() and correlating it with colors to generate a random color for the player to guess.
